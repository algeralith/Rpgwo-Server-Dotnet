-Guarentee packets arrive when they are meant to. I.E, no login during ingame state.
-Need to handle the limitations around skills. As in, 99 points are the maximum you can set a skill too
 since Mickey adds + 100 to any free skill.
-Minimum Attribute points need to be 60. 10 for each attr, then 10 for life.
-Need to verify Head/Arms/Chest/Leg values at some point.
-Need to ensure name uniqueness.
-Need to make sure account is not already online.
